## Strategies

1. **Dual Class Arbitrage**: A trading strategy that involves taking advantage of the price discrepancy that exists between stocks that have dual listings.
2. **Bollinger Band Strategy**: A strategy that uses Bollinger Bands calculated using a 20-day simple moving average (SMA) and standard deviations.
3. **Reinforcement Learning Algorithm**: An algorithm that leverages reinforcement learning for algo trading.
4. **Sector-Based Pairs Trading Algorithm**: A strategy that capitalizes on price deviations of two assets within the same sector.
